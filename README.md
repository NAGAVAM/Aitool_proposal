🎧 VoiceMyMood – AI-Generated Audio Experiences for Every Moment
🚀 Project Overview
VoiceMyMood is an AI-powered tool integrated with Kuku FM to generate short, mood-based audio content for users. By analyzing user input or detecting mood passively, it generates voice snippets aligned with a listener's emotional state. This solution increases user retention, daily app opens, and session durations through hyper-personalized, emotionally resonant content.

🎯 Objective
Help users instantly discover and listen to mood-relevant content (1–5 minutes).

Reduce decision fatigue during content browsing.

Trigger audio based on daily routines (e.g., morning motivation, evening wind-down).

Boost average session length and app open frequency.

🧠 AI Techniques Used
Component	Technology Used
Script Generation	Custom LLM fine-tuned for audio storytelling
Mood Detection	BERT or DistilBERT-based sentiment classifier
Voice Synthesis	Google TTS / ElevenLabs / Coqui
Recommendation Engine	Collaborative filtering + user metadata
📱 Key Features
Mood Selector & Detection: Choose a mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, Calm, Excited) or allow AI to detect it passively.

Audio Previews: Instantly hear AI-generated stories or affirmations.

Voice & Language Customization: Pick male/female voices, regional accents, or preferred languages.

Mood History: Track and revisit previously played moods with emojis.

Routine Triggers: Auto-play content during set routines like morning prep or workouts.
